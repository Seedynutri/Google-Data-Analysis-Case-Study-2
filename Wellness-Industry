**Google Data Analytics Certificate Project**

**Project Title:** Data Analytics for Healthcare: Optimising Outcomes through Insightful Analysis

**Description:**
This project was part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate and focused on applying data analytics principles to healthcare data. The objective was to leverage statistical analysis and data visualisation tools to optimise healthcare outcomes, such as improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing decision-making processes. Through the analysis of real-world healthcare datasets, the project aimed to demonstrate how data-driven insights can lead to actionable results in the medical field.

**Objectives:**

- Explore and Clean Data: Understand healthcare data by cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw datasets for analysis.
- Data Visualisation: Use various visualisation tools to present healthcare data trends and patterns effectively.
- Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical techniques to identify correlations and patterns that impact healthcare outcomes.
- Report Generation: Develop comprehensive reports summarising findings and making recommendations for improvement in healthcare services.
- Decision-Making Support: Provide actionable insights to help healthcare providers make data-informed decisions.
- Predictive Analytics: Use basic predictive models to foresee healthcare trends and suggest preventive measures.

**Tools Used:**

- Google Sheets/Excel: For data cleaning, transformation, and initial analysis.
- SQL: For querying and filtering large healthcare datasets.
- R: For advanced statistical analysis and building data visualisations.
- Tableau: For creating dashboards and presenting data insights in a visually compelling format.
- Google Data Studio: For creating real-time reports and interactive data visualisations.

Key Steps in the Project:
- Data Collection: Gathered raw datasets from public healthcare repositories. Datasets included patient demographics, medical history, treatment outcomes, etc.
- Data Cleaning: Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) to handle missing data, duplicates, and outliers. This ensured that the data was ready for analysis.
- Data Exploration: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using descriptive statistics and visualisations to understand the basic trends in the dataset.
- Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical methods like regression and correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables and identify key predictors of health outcomes.
- Visualisation: Built interactive dashboards using Tableau and Google Data Studio to provide a visual representation of trends in patient care, resource utilisation, and more.
- Reporting: Developed a comprehensive report summarising findings, including recommendations for healthcare improvements based on data insights.
- Predictive Analytics: Built basic predictive models using R to forecast future healthcare trends (e.g., patient readmission rates, disease outbreaks).

**Skills Gained**

- **Data Wrangling:** Mastery of cleaning, structuring, and transforming data into usable formats for analysis.
- **Data Visualisation:** Proficiency in creating impactful visualisations using Tableau, Google Data Studio, and R.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Strong understanding of statistical tests and their application in real-world scenarios.
- **SQL for Data Analysis:** Enhanced SQL skills for querying large datasets and extracting valuable insights.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Gained experience in building predictive models for forecasting future healthcare trends.
- **Problem Solving and Critical Thinking:** Developed the ability to approach complex healthcare challenges with data-driven solutions.

**Why This Project Matters**
Healthcare is an industry that can benefit significantly from data analytics, and this project demonstrates how insights derived from data can improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency. By using a variety of data analysis techniques, this project showcases how data can be applied in a meaningful way to optimise healthcare systems, ultimately contributing to better decision-making, resource management, and patient care. Developed the ability to approach complex healthcare challenges with data-driven solutions.
